# Atom One Dark - Green Theme

A fork of the [VSCode Atom One Dark theme](https://github.com/akamud/vscode-theme-onedark), with green accents and darker, softer colors for reduced eye strain.

## Installing

This extension is available for free in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pierce-martin.vscode-theme-onedark-green)  

## Customization

If you are using VSCode 1.12+ versions you can customize the colors to your liking, overriding the ones provided by this theme. More info [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).

### Custom Font

The original One Dark theme does not use a custom font, for that reason I don't supply a custom font either, but you might be used to see screenshots of the One Dark theme using the [Fira Mono](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) font. You can easily [customize your settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) to use it.  
If you download and install the font in your system, you can add this option to have a custom font:

```json
{
    "editor.fontFamily": "YOUR FONT, Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace"
}
```
